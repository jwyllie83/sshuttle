Description: "Full-featured" VPN over an SSH tunnel, allowing full remote
 access somewhere where all you have is an SSH connection.  It works well if
 you generally find yourself in the following situation:
 .
 - Your client machine (or router) is Linux, FreeBSD, or MacOS.
 - You have access to a remote network via ssh.
 - You don't necessarily have admin access on the remote network.
 - You do not wish to, or can't, use other VPN software
 - You don't want to create an ssh port forward for every
    single host/port on the remote network.
 - You hate openssh's port forwarding because it's randomly
    slow and/or stupid.
 - You can't use openssh's PermitTunnel feature because
    it's disabled by default on openssh servers; plus it does
    TCP-over-TCP, which has suboptimal performance
 .
 It also has hooks for more complicated setups (VPN-in-a-SSH-VPN, etc) to allow
 you to set it up as you like.
